A very simple React & Express SSR Application based on react-server-boilerplate (https://github.com/Roilan/react-server-boilerplate), which itself is very basic and has some problems making the CSS file.  But as a very basic example to build off, it works.

#### $ npm run-script build

#### $ npm run-script start

rinse, repeat
